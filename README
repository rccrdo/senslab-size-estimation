A Contiki-OS based neighborhood size estimator for the SensLab WSN platform.

The C sources for distributed size-estimation are inside
"senslab-app". The folder "scripts" contains a few post-processing
tools that facilitate working with the SensLab infrastructure.

Warning: The size-estimator has been developed against
git-rev. 4bc8aab4c7a90db4d03c7a3296649f3ff861b454 of SensLab's source
code distribution.

For correct operation you must first apply the patch in
"patches/senslab-contiki.diff". This is needed to fix a time-keeping
bug in the kernel and introduce a helper function to tweak the radio
tx power.
